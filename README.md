freeCodeCamp's pinterest clone challenge

## Objectives:
As an authenticated user, I can...
* login with GitHub
* login with Google
* create pins
* delete pins
* see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to
* browse other users' walls of images
*  if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image
